# Smart Documentation Rules

## **Core Principle**
- Documentation should be **purposeful** and **aligned** with the epic/requirement system
- Avoid creating random documentation files that don't serve the immediate system needs
- Focus on updating **handoffs**, **requirements**, and **done** items rather than creating new docs

## **Documentation Priorities**

### **✅ DO: System-Aligned Documentation**
- **Update handoff documents** when work is complete or needs transfer
- **Update requirements** (Gherkin files) when specifications change
- **Move items to DONE** with completion notes when work is finished
- **Create epic/requirement documentation** that directly supports the workflow
- **Update rule files** when new patterns emerge from actual code

### **❌ DON'T: Scattered Documentation**
- Don't create random `.md` files that don't fit the system
- Don't create "guides" or "usage" docs unless specifically requested
- Don't create documentation about past fixes or workflow changes
- Don't document theoretical approaches - focus on actual implementation

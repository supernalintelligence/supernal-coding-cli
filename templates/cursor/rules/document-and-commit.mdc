# Document and Commit Rules

## **Smart Documentation Updates**

### **✅ DO: System-Aligned Documentation**
- **Update handoff documents** when completing work or transferring to another agent
- **Update requirements** (Gherkin files) when specifications change during implementation
- **Move completed items to DONE** with completion notes and timestamps
- **Update epic progress** when requirements are completed
- **Create new requirements** when new needs are discovered during implementation

### **✅ DO: Commit with Requirements Traceability**
- **Use REQ-XXX commit format** when implementing requirements: `REQ-001: Implement user login validation`
- **Reference specific requirements** in commit messages
- **Update requirement status** when code is committed
- **Create feature branches** following pattern: `feature/req-001-user-login`

### **✅ DO: Smart Commit Practices**
- **Commit specific files** related to the requirement being implemented
- **Stage requirement updates** along with code changes
- **Update rule files** when new patterns emerge from actual implementation
- **Commit handoff documents** when work is complete

### **❌ DON'T: Scattered Documentation**
- Don't create random documentation files that don't fit the system
- Don't commit unrelated changes together
- Don't update documentation without corresponding code changes
- Don't commit without updating relevant requirement status

## **Implementation Pattern**
1. **Work on requirement** → Code changes
2. **Update requirement** → Mark progress or completion
3. **Commit together** → Code + requirement updates
4. **Follow naming** → Use REQ-XXX format
5. **Update handoff** → When work is complete or transferred

When you create something, name it properly. From folders, files, files, functions, names etc... Name it properly to begin with. This means appropriate casing, appropriate descriptions. No non-descriptive adjectives, like 'new', or 'advanced', 'improved', or 'legacy' (in fact avoid creating legacy to begin with, you should edit the original if you're going to do it).

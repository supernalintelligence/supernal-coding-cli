Great work! When you need to hand off your work or when you're feeling overburdened, 
use the agent handoff system for smooth knowledge transfer.

# Agent Hand-Off Process by Status

## 🎯 **Determine Handoff Type First**

Before creating a handoff, determine which type applies:

### ✅ **RESOLVED/COMPLETED Handoff**
- Task, feature, or issue has been **successfully completed**
- All acceptance criteria met
- No further work needed on this specific item
- Ready for review/merge or already merged

### 🔄 **UNRESOLVED/IN-PROGRESS Handoff**  
- Work is **incomplete** or **blocked**
- Issue not fully resolved
- Requires continuation by next agent
- May have encountered obstacles

---

## ✅ **RESOLVED/COMPLETED Handoff Workflow**

### 1. Create Completion Handoff
```bash
sc agent handoff --title "completed-[component-name]"
# Example: sc agent handoff --title "completed-priority-system-rewrite"
```

### 2. Focus on Documentation & Closure
**Priority Information to Include:**
- **✅ What was accomplished** - Detailed completion summary
- **🎯 Success metrics** - How you know it's complete
- **📚 Lessons learned** - What worked well, what didn't
- **🔄 Follow-up work** - Any maintenance or future enhancements
- **🧪 Testing performed** - Verification steps taken
- **📁 Files modified** - Complete list of changes made

### 3. Completion Transition Blurb Template
```
✅ COMPLETED HAND-OFF: [Brief description of completed work]

📁 **Hand-off Document**: supernal-coding/kanban/handoffs/completed-[component-name]-YYYY-MM-DD.md
🌿 **Branch Status**: [Ready for merge / Already merged / Closed]
🎯 **Accomplishments**: [Top 3 things completed]
📋 **Files Modified**: [List of changed files]
✅ **Verified Working**: [Comprehensive testing/verification done]
🔄 **Follow-up**: [Any maintenance or future work identified]

**Context**: [Summary of approach taken and final outcomes]
**Lessons Learned**: [Key insights for future similar work]
```

### 4. File Management for Completed Work
- Keep in `supernal-coding/kanban/handoffs/` initially
- Mark with **Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED** in the handoff
- After review, move to `supernal-coding/kanban/done/`

---

## 🔄 **UNRESOLVED/IN-PROGRESS Handoff Workflow**

### 1. Create Continuation Handoff
```bash
sc agent handoff --title "inprogress-[component-name]"
# Example: sc agent handoff --title "inprogress-auth-system-debugging"
```

### 2. Focus on Current State & Next Steps
**Priority Information to Include:**
- **🎯 Current objective** - What you were trying to accomplish
- **🔄 Progress made** - What's been completed so far
- **🚧 Current blockers** - Specific issues encountered
- **🧪 What's been tried** - Approaches attempted and results
- **💡 Debugging info** - Error messages, logs, investigation findings
- **📍 Exact stopping point** - Where the next agent should start

### 3. In-Progress Transition Blurb Template
```
🔄 IN-PROGRESS HAND-OFF: [Brief description of ongoing work]

📁 **Hand-off Document**: supernal-coding/kanban/handoffs/inprogress-[component-name]-YYYY-MM-DD.md
🌿 **Branch Status**: [Needs more work / Has blockers / Experimental]
🎯 **Current Objective**: [What we're trying to achieve]
📋 **Progress Made**: [What's working so far]
🚧 **Current Blockers**: [Specific issues to resolve]
🔄 **Next Actions**: [Immediate steps for continuation]

**Context**: [What approach was being taken and why]
**Debugging Info**: [Key error messages, logs, or investigation findings]
**Estimated Time**: [Time estimate for resolution]
```

### 4. File Management for Ongoing Work
- Keep in `supernal-coding/kanban/handoffs/` for immediate pickup
- Mark with **Status**: 🔄 **IN-PROGRESS** or 🚧 **BLOCKED**
- Move to `supernal-coding/kanban/doing/` when work resumes

---

## 🛠 **Common Steps for Both Types**

### 1. Pre-Handoff Check
```bash
# Always document current state first
git branch                    # Current branch
git status                   # Working directory state
npm run build                # Build status (if applicable)
npm run test                 # Test status (if applicable)
```

### 2. Review Existing Handoffs
```bash
sc agent handoff              # See what handoffs already exist
```

### 3. Fill Template Thoroughly
- Replace all `[FILL IN]` placeholders
- Be specific and actionable
- Include exact file paths and line numbers when relevant
- Add any relevant error messages or logs

### 4. File Organization
- **Active handoffs**: Stay in `supernal-coding/kanban/handoffs/`
- **Work resumed**: Move to `supernal-coding/kanban/doing/`
- **Work completed**: Move to `supernal-coding/kanban/done/`
- **Old/archived**: Auto-cleanup after 3 months

## 🚨 **Special Situations**

### When Work is BLOCKED
- Use **BLOCKED** status in handoff
- Focus heavily on the blocker details
- Include what was tried to resolve the blocker
- Suggest alternative approaches or escalation paths

### When Work is EXPERIMENTAL
- Mark branch as **Experimental** 
- Include success/failure criteria
- Document what was learned even if approach failed
- Suggest whether to continue or try different approach

### When Emergency Handoff Needed
- Create handoff immediately, even if incomplete
- Mark as **URGENT** in the title
- Include current state and immediate concerns
- Provide emergency contact or escalation info

## 📋 **Quality Checklist**

Before sharing your handoff:
- [ ] Status type clearly identified (COMPLETED vs IN-PROGRESS)
- [ ] Branch name and status documented
- [ ] All [FILL IN] placeholders replaced
- [ ] Specific file paths and changes listed
- [ ] Next steps are actionable and clear
- [ ] Testing/verification status documented
- [ ] Any blockers or issues clearly explained

---

**Remember**: A good hand-off saves the next agent hours of investigation and ensures project momentum continues smoothly. Be thorough, honest, specific, and always include branch management context.

Do not ever say in any way whatsoever that something is complete until it has been tested. If you have tested it yourself, those tests are not 'fake' tests that don't test anything really or easily give false-positives, and the tests pass, then you may say that it is likely complete and may warrant manual testing. If a user says that it is complete, then it is quite complete.
